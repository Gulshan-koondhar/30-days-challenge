# Day 7 Task - Spec-Kit

## What is Spec-Kit Plus?

- Spec-kit pilus is framework which works on a spec-driven development concept. It not only generates code but also reuses intelligence by analyzing the features which I built earlier. First it understands my design patterns, reasoning and problem-solving techniques and then reuses those in my other projects. This makes development faster, clearer, and more consistent by preserving both your code and the thinking behind it. It has Five core concepts which are given below.

1. **/sp.constitution:**

- This step establishes the foundation of our project. It sets the guiding principles, and rules that all future specs, plans, and implementations must follow. It is just like the same as the constitution of any country.

2. **/sp.specify:**

- In this step, we write a precise, structured specification for the feature we are building. It defines what the feature must do and why. This ensures clarity before any planning or coding begins and avoids ambiguity.

3. **/sp.plan:**

- This step generates a detailed development plan based on the specification. It breaks the feature into logical components, outlines architecture choices, and identifies steps needed to build the solution.

4. **/sp.tasks:**

- Based on the plan, this step converts everything into small, actionable tasks. Each task includes clear instructions that can be executed by either a human developer or an AI agent. It ensures the work is well-organized and manageable.

5. **/sp.implement:**

- Finally, this command produces the actual code for each task. It follows the specs, plan, and constitution strictly so that implementation remains consistent and aligned with the original intent.
