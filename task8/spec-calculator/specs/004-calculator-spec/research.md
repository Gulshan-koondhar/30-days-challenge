## Research Tasks

### Task 1: Parsing Strategies and Libraries

- **Decision**: [To be determined]
- **Rationale**: [To be determined]
- **Alternatives Considered**: [To be determined]
Research suitable parsing strategies/libraries for mathematical expressions in Python. For Python, consider libraries like `ast` for built-in parsing, or external libraries like `numexpr` or `SymPy` for more advanced features. Manual parsing is also an option for simpler expressions.

### Task 2: Expression Evaluation Engine Best Practices

- **Decision**: [To be determined]
- **Rationale**: [To be determined]
- **Alternatives Considered**: [To be determined]
Investigate best practices for building a robust mathematical expression evaluation engine in Python. This includes handling floating-point arithmetic precision, efficient calculation of ASTs, and secure evaluation to prevent unintended code execution if expressions were user-supplied and could contain arbitrary code (though this is less of a concern for a simple calculator, it's good practice to consider).

### Task 3: Error Handling Patterns

- **Decision**: [To be determined]
- **Rationale**: [To be determined]
- **Alternatives Considered**: [To be determined]
- **Research Focus**: Research standard and effective error handling patterns for input validation and arithmetic errors (e.g., division by zero, invalid syntax, overflow). Focus on providing clear, user-friendly error messages.
