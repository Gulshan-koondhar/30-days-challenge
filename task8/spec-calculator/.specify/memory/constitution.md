# Simple Calculator Constitution
<!-- Constitution for a simple calculator project with basic operations -->

## Core Principles

### Simplicity and Clarity
<!-- The calculator should perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) in a straightforward manner. The user interface should be intuitive and uncluttered, prioritizing ease of use for common tasks. -->
The calculator should perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) in a straightforward manner. The user interface should be intuitive and uncluttered, prioritizing ease of use for common tasks.

### Accuracy and Reliability
<!-- All calculations must be accurate and produce correct results. Edge cases, such as division by zero or invalid inputs, must be handled gracefully with clear feedback to the user. -->

### Testability
<!-- The codebase must be structured to facilitate easy unit and integration testing for all operations. Test coverage should be comprehensive for core functionalities. -->
