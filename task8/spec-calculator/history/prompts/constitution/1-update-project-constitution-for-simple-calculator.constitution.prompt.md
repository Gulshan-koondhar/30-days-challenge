  I have updated the `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.

  Here's a summary of the changes:

  *   **Version Change**: `v0.1.0` → `v0.2.0`
  *   **Rationale for Version Bump**: Added new core principles for a "Simple Calculator" project, focusing on Simplicity/Clarity, Accuracy/Reliability, Testability, and Maintainable Code.
  *   **Modified Principles**:
      *   Introduced "Simplicity and Clarity" principle.
      *   Introduced "Accuracy and Reliability" principle.
      *   Introduced "Testability" principle.
      *   Introduced "Maintainable Code" principle.
  *   **Removed Sections**: No sections were explicitly removed from the template.
  *   **Templates Requiring Updates**:
      *   `plan-template.md`: General alignment with new principles is expected. No specific changes are flagged as mandatory at this stage.
      *   `spec-template.md`: The new principles directly inform specification requirements for clarity, accuracy, and testability.
      *   `tasks-template.md`: The "Testability" principle will directly influence task creation and prioritization.
      *   Command files: No outdated agent-specific references were identified.
  *   **Deferred TODOs**: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is marked as a TODO, as the original date was not provided.

  **Suggested Commit Message**:
  `docs: amend constitution to v0.2.0 (add calculator principles)`

  Please let me know if you would like any adjustments or further documentation.

  Now, I will create a Prompt History Record for this action.
